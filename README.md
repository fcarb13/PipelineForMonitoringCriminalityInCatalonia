# PipelineForMonitoringCriminalityInCatalonia

Nowadays, Twitter has emerged as one of the most popular social networks as it allows users to share brief messages on any topic of their choice. Consequently, it has become a valuable tool for staying updated with the latest news and trends. Recognizing the growing concern surrounding criminality in recent years, this TFG aims to leverage the potential of Twitter to track and analyse criminal activities specifically in Catalonia through the examination of posted tweets. To do this, web scraping techniques will be used to gather the tweets, and text processing methods will extract location information. The collected tweets, along with their location data, will be stored and regularly updated in a database. Pre-processing steps will be applied to facilitate classification and analysis. The system will automatically classify the tweets, differentiating between those related to criminal acts and others. To sum up, visual representations, including mapping techniques, will be used to provide precise geolocation information as the goal is to visually present the analysed data.
